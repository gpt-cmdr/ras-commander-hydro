RAS Commander is coming to 
Arc Hydro Tools

Bringing HEC-RAS 6.x Direct Data Access to ArcGIS

•ESRI has Partnered with CLB Engineering 
Corporation's Willliam "Bill" Katzenmeyer, creator 
of the RAS CommanderOpen Source Python 
Library
•Usingan LLM Forward approach, CLB has rapidly 
developed a subset of HDF data 
accessfunctionality into an ArcGIS Toolbox
•Features for Initial Release:
o1D and 2D Geometry Extraction
oMaxWSE and Velocity as 2DMesh Results
oTerrain Import for Inundation Mapping
oSupport for HEC-RAS 2D Models






Free and Open Source Tools Brought to You By: 


Load 1D and 2D 
Geometry Elements

Assist with Report Figures and Visualizations

•Bring all of your 1D and 2D geometry 
elements right into ArcGIS
•Includes Pipe Networks for Urban 
Drainage! 
•Column names are preserved and should 
be identical to RAS Mapper except where 
special characters were used in the HDF


Bonus: Exporting Mesh Cells as polygons 
allows for mesh-based spatial analysis 
methods not available in RAS Mapper.



2D Results Summaries

Raw Mesh Results Data as Points

•Max WSEL at Cell Centers
•Max Velocity at Cell Faces
•Timestamps for Maximum Values



Note: 1D-only results can still be loaded via SDF and existing Arc Hydro workflows

Direct 2D Mesh Results Export Provides Unique 
Opportunities for Advanced Spatial Analysis


Organize an Entire HEC-RAS Projectas Geodatabase

Create Rich HEC-RAS Data Inventories in ArcGIS

•Finds All Results HDF Files .pXX.hdf
•Extracts all 1D, 2D Geometry and 2D Mesh 
Results Data 
•Creates Non-Overlapping Layer Names
•Organizes layers by Plan Number


Coming Soon: 

Improved Schemas

Improved Layer Styling

Instructional Webinar



Roadmap

Where is RAS Commander in Arc Hydro going?

This is an LLM Forward Experiment, coded after 
an ASFPM brainstorming session in Late May 
2025. With public release in Early July 2025, this 
was alittle over a month of time. 

Our First Goal is to Get Community Feedback 
about desired HEC-RAS 6.x data integration 
capabilities in ArcGIS

Our Current Roadmap: 

Layer Styling

Schemas

1D Results

2D PipesResults

Fluvial/Pluvial 
Delineation

Probabilistic Approaches

Land Use Layers

Plan and Unsteady 
Metadata

Syncing Changes back 
to HEC-RAS
