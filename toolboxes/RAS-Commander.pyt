#
# ArcGIS Python Toolbox for HEC-RAS HDF5 Data Integration
# ===================================================================================
#
# ESRI PARTNERSHIP ANNOUNCEMENT:
# ESRI has partnered with CLB Engineering Corporation's William "Bill" Katzenmeyer,
# Vice President and creator of the RAS Commander Open Source Python Library, to bring
# powerful HEC-RAS 6.x HDF5 data extraction capabilities directly into ArcGIS Pro.
#
# LAUNCHING AT ESRI USER CONFERENCE 2025
# This toolbox represents a groundbreaking application of LLM Forward engineering,
# developed in just over a month following an ASFPM brainstorming session in May 2025.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This toolbox provides comprehensive tools for loading and visualizing HEC-RAS 1D and 2D
# geometry, terrain, and results data from HDF5 files directly within ArcGIS Pro.
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# â€¢ Direct HDF5 data access without manual conversion
# â€¢ Support for 1D and 2D geometry elements
# â€¢ Pipe network extraction (storm/sewer systems)
# â€¢ Results visualization (Max WSE and Velocity)
# â€¢ Terrain import from RAS Mapper
# â€¢ Complete project organization
#
# ORIGIN AND ATTRIBUTION:
# This toolbox is a direct port of the HDF5 data extraction logic from the
# ras-commander library, adapted for the ArcGIS platform using CLB's innovative
# LLM Forward approach.
#

#
# COMMUNITY DRIVEN:
# This is a community-driven effort. We're actively seeking feedback from:
# - Municipalities integrating HEC-RAS data into dashboards
# - Engineers communicating multi-hazard flood risk
# - GIS professionals preparing 2D model data
# - Researchers analyzing model results
#

        This toolbox is the result of ESRI's partnership with CLB Engineering Corporation's 
        William "Bill" Katzenmeyer, creator of the RAS Commander Open Source Python Library.
        
        Using CLB's innovative LLM Forward approach, this toolbox was developed in just over 
        a month, demonstrating the transformative potential of AI-assisted development in 
        the water resources sector.
        
        KEY CAPABILITIES:
        â€¢ Direct HDF5 Import - No conversion needed
        â€¢ 1D and 2D Geometry - Complete model extraction
        â€¢ Pipe Networks - Storm/sewer system support
        â€¢ Results Analysis - Max WSE and velocity visualization
        â€¢ Terrain Integration - RAS Mapper VRT import
        â€¢ Project Organization - Batch processing tools
